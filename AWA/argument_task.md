1. Proofread your essay.
2. Alternate the use of small and large sentences. 
3. Avoid the repeated use of words.
4. Use proper punctuation wherever necessary. 
5. Explicate the arguement at hand. 
6. Identify the conclusion, evidence and assumptions and use these as points to refute/support the argument. 
7. Try to use his/her when refering to the author. 
8. Add filler statements to make the transition from one paragraph to another like, in addition to, moreover, furthermore etc. 

Dummy template
------------------
While it may be true \<the arguement\> it does not make a cogent case for \<the conclusion\>. It is easy to understand that this argument is rife with holes and assumptions, thus not strong enough to lead to \<the conclusion\>

(If a survey is refered)
Citing surveys, the author reports \<the result of the survey\>. It is not clear, however, the scope and validity of that survey. For example, \<points that prove the survey irrelavant\>. Unless the survey is fully representative, valid and reliable, it can not be used to effectively back the author's arguments. 


Additionally, the author implies that \<state the implications\>. To strengthen his/her argument, the author will benifit from implementing a normed survey, asking wide range of people. 

Building upon the implication of the \<assumption\>, the author states that \<conclusion\>. (Give pointers to refute the argument)

For these reasons, \<what you suggest has to be done\>. However, this author's argumentis not likely significantly persuade \<conclusion\>.
