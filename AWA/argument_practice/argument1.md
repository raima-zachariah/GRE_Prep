 "Seven years ago, homeowners in nearby Brookville community adopted a set of restrictions on how the community's yards should be landscaped and what colors the exteriors of homes should be painted. Since then, average property values have tripled in Brookville. In order to raise property values in Deerhaven Acres, we should adopt our own set of restrictions on landscaping and house painting." 


 While, Deerhaven Acres, adopting their own set of restrictions on landscaping and house painting may appear as a cogent case for increasing the average property values, it is easy to understand that this argument is rife with holes and assumptions, thus not strong enough to lead to an considerable increase in property valuations.

 Citing the example of prior success of adopting similar restrictions by Brookville, the author makes a claim that implementing such reforms will no doubt result in increase in property valuations in Deerhaven Acres. It is not clear, however, from the given statement what restrictions have been enforced in Brookville and how similar or different are the restrictions drafted by Deerhaven. For example, the residents in Brookville might have decided to paint their houses white which have a better appeal. But on similar lines, if Deerhaven decides to paint it red, it might not result in the same results. Unless the cited example is fully representative, reliable and valid, it can't be used effectively to bolster the authors arguement. 

 In addition, the author also mentions that the restricitions also took into account the landscaping of the community yards. It is implicit that an asthetic appeal to the community yard will help improve the property rates, but it is not dilienated what changes were brought about. It could have been the case that Brookville didnt have a community yard at all in the first place. But since we can't make a straightforward mapping between both the communities, we cant blindly believe that changes in one community might really help the other. 

 Also, the property value trippling in Brookville could have been the outcome of a plethora of factors like development of the area near the community, emerging new schools or other amenities. A property valuation is usually seen to increase with the proximity to such amenities. 

 For these reasons, it is better that a thorough investigation be carried out before the restrictions are enforced. This will help clarify if the proposed measures will prove beneficial or not. However, the author's case is less likely to persuade the property valuations.
